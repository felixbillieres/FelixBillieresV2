# ⁉️ Whoami

Hi, I’m **Felix Billieres**, a **Junior Penetration Tester** with a focus on **Active Directory pentesting** and **Web application security**. I hold the **PNPT certification** and am currently preparing for the **OSCP**.

I’m a student at [**École 2600**](https://www.2600.eu/) 🎓, where I deepen my knowledge of penetration testing and vulnerability research. Outside of my studies, I actively do **Hack The Box**, **PortSwigger Academy**, and **RootMe**, using these platforms to sharpen my expertise.

I also engage in **bug bounty hunting**, exploring real-world applications to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Additionally, I enjoy participating in **CTFs**, with particular interest in **web exploitation**, **forensics, LLM** and sometimes **pwn** challenges.
