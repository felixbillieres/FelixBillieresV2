# 🏛️ The Pentest Maze of Babel

### 🌀 Welcome to the Maze

Welcome to **The Pentest Maze of Babel**, a place where knowledge about penetration testing, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and cybersecurity practices is organized and shared. This GitBook is a personal repository of my journey in the world of pentesting, documenting everything I learn as I navigate the complexities of cybersecurity, particularly in **web security** 🌐 and **Active Directory** 🖥️ exploitation.

My name is **Felix Billieres** 👋, and I am a Junior Penetration Tester that likes to solve security challenges and learning how to break stuff. I am currently a student at **École 2600** 🎓, where I continue to deepen my skills🛡️.

### 🏛️ Why The "Maze of Babel"?

Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short story _The Library of Babel_ 📖, this GitBook is named after the **infinite labyrinth of knowledge** that penetration testing can feel like. Every new concept, tool, or technique is like a book in the library 📚 — sometimes obscure, sometimes overwhelming, but always valuable once deciphered. The world of pentesting is vast, but with determination and curiosity, we can piece together the critical knowledge to navigate it.

Welcome to the **Maze of Babel**. 🚀
