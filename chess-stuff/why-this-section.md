# ✅ Why This Section?

Usually, I focus on writing documentation about **pentesting** and **offensive security**, but this time, I’m stepping out of my usual domain to explore another hobby of mine: **chess.**

I already play a lot of chess games, but I lack the theoretical rigor needed to perform at a higher level. While I can rely on intuition, I often find myself missing key strategic plans or making avoidable mistakes due to gaps in my theoretical understanding.

This section is my way of **forcing myself to develop a rock-solid theoretical foundation**—a structured approach to chess improvement that will help me refine my decision-making, deepen my understanding of critical concepts, and ultimately, push my rating to new heights.

The goal of this documentation is twofold:

1. **Structure my learning process** in a rigorous way by deep-diving into strategic, tactical, and theoretical concepts to reach a solid level (\~2000 Elo).
2. **Produce clear and well-organized content** that could also benefit other players looking for a structured approach to improvement.

I’ll be compiling **theory, plans, pawn structures, endgames, openings, and chess psychology**, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to elevate my level and develop a high-quality knowledge base.

Hope this can help some of you!
