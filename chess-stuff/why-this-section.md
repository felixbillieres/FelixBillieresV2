# ✅ Why This Section?

Usually, I focus on writing documentation about **pentesting** and **offensive security**, but this time, I’m stepping out of my usual domain to explore something entirely different: **chess**.

The goal of this documentation is twofold:

1. **Structure my learning process** in a rigorous way by deep-diving into strategic, tactical, and theoretical concepts to reach a solid level (\~2000 Elo).
2. **Produce clear and well-organized content** that could also benefit other players looking for a structured approach to improvement.

I’ll be compiling **theory, plans, pawn structures, endgames, openings, and chess psychology**, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to elevate my level and develop a high-quality knowledge base.
