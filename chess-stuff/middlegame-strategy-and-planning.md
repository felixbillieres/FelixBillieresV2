# ðŸŽ¯ Middlegame â€“ Strategy & Planning

* Positional evaluation (material, activity, pawn structure, king safety, initiative)
* Weaknesses and strong squares (exploiting and defending)
* Typical plans for different pawn structures:
  * **Carlsbad structure** (minority attack, central play)
  * **Sicilian structures** (Hedgehog, Maroczy Bind, Open Sicilian)
  * **GrÃ¼nfeld & Kingâ€™s Indian structures** (dynamic pawn breaks)
* Initiative and attacking play
* Defense and counterplay
* Minor piece dynamics: Knight vs. Bishop
* Transitioning to the endgame
