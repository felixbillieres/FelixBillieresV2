{% hint style="info" %}
Info: Can you recover the admin password ?
{% endhint %}

Here is the code we start with:

```sql
--return
SELECT `username` FROM `users`
WHERE (
     username LIKE '%%' 
  OR    email LIKE '%%'
); 
```

The first thing that i try is looking at how the input is processed ->

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

What comes to my mind is the famous auth bypass `' OR 1=1-- -` but so i look at something like that:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

so it looks like we escaped the user input, let's dig deeper because if i submit this payload i get the following error:

```
Parse error near line 3: no such table: users
```

will continue later... Need coffee
