#### The admin of this website made a GDPR form, but he doesn't reply to any complains.

Show the **admin** how you can leak information about users by stealing his **username** and **password**.

### Goal

Recover the admin information in a single query, the output **must** look like this

text: `admin:<email>:<password>`
{% endhint %}

Here is the code that we have:

```sql
-- run
CREATE TABLE complain (text TEXT);
-- run
INSERT INTO complain(text) VALUES ('' AND 0); /* I don't really care about your complains */

-- return
SELECT 
  text
FROM complain
LIMIT 5;
```

After looking for the terms that i didn't quite understand i found this article:

{% embed url="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/isnt-it-ironic-exploiting-gdpr-laws-to-gain-access-to-personal-data" %}

I have to input an email so i tried `admin@test.com` and had `0` as the output

SQL evaluates `'admin@test.com' AND 0`:

* In SQL, logical `AND` evaluates both sides. Here, any non-empty string like `'admin@test.com'` is treated as `TRUE`.
* `0` is treated as `FALSE`.
* `TRUE AND FALSE` evaluates to `FALSE`, and in SQLite, `FALSE` is represented as `0`.

As a result, the value `0` is inserted into the `text` column.

So i tried escaping the user input to retrieve some informations without thinking too much at first:

Key points that we can note:

* our "-" is blacklisted
* SELECT is not in the output

Those seem odd until i looked at the nodes that we're named "blacklist" and "Regex replace" (now it's not so odd anymore :joy:)

Makes sense now, let's go deeper now that we know this

So i looked up different techniques to replace those inputs and tried the following payloads:

```sql
') UNION ALL (S||E||L||E||C||T email FROM users)# 
#and
') UNION ALL VALUES('admin@example.com')#
```

Did not work and i got pretty much the same error ->

```
Parse error near line 5: near "(": syntax error
  INSERT INTO complain(text) VALUES ('') UNION ALL (S||E||L||E||C||T email FROM 
                                     error here ---^
```

```
Parse error near line 5: near "''": syntax error
  VALUES ('') UNION ALL VALUES('admin@example.com')'' AND 0); /* I don't really
                                      error here ---^
```

So i took a step backwards and focused on only trying to escape properly all user inputs and got the hang of it with the following payload:

```
') ('
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

and luckily with a mistype i got the following output that caught my eye:

```
') UNION SELECTs('
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

so from there i told myself that it was the way to go to bypass the regex problem and got a valid input:

```
') UNION SELECTselect ('
```

Then i went to the following cheat sheet to see some enumeration commands:
