# üõ¢Ô∏è Server-side Attacks

When exploring the fascinating maze of web application security, understanding server-side attacks is crucial. While client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking target users' browsers, server-side attacks exploit vulnerabilities on the server itself‚Äîwhere the application's logic and sensitive data reside. These attacks can have far-reaching consequences, compromising the server, its internal network, and potentially the entire infrastructure.

#### **Why Server-Side Attacks Matter**

**Client-Side vs. Server-Side**

1. **Client-Side Attacks**:
   * Exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser or client application.
   * Impact is often limited to individual users (e.g., stealing cookies or phishing).
   * Mitigated by browser security measures like CSP and sanitization techniques.
2. **Server-Side Attacks**:
   * Exploit vulnerabilities in the server‚Äôs processing logic or behavior.
   * Often grant attackers direct access to the backend, databases, or sensitive operations.
   * Consequences include **data breaches**, **privilege escalation**, **remote code execution (RCE)**, and even **server takeover**.

#### **Unique Dangers of Server-Side Attacks**

Server-side vulnerabilities expose risks that client-side attacks cannot replicate:

1. **Access to Sensitive Data**:
   * Servers manage databases, private files, and APIs. Exploiting server-side vulnerabilities may expose customer records, credentials, or proprietary information.
   * Example: Extracting database contents via an SQL Injection (SQLi).
2. **Infrastructure Exposure**:
   * Servers often connect to internal services that aren‚Äôt exposed to the internet.
   * Example: SSRF attacks can access cloud metadata services, internal APIs, or admin panels.
3. **Execution of Arbitrary Code**:
   * Server-side template injection or command injection vulnerabilities can let attackers run arbitrary commands, leading to complete server control.
4. **Bypassing Client-Side Protections**:
   * Even if client-side input validation is implemented, server-side vulnerabilities can ignore or bypass those protections.
