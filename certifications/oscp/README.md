# ðŸ¦ˆ OSCP

This section is dedicated to my journey in preparing for the OSCP exam. Here, I'll document my progress, share key learnings, and gather useful resources along the way. This will serve as both a personal roadmap and a reference for others looking to tackle the OSCP challenge.

99% of my preparation for the OSCP exam consists of practicing labs from Offsec called **Proving Grounds (**[**TJNull list**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview)**)** and **Hack The Box machines**. This section will document my journey, challenges, and key takeaways along the way.
